slide 1

slide 2
- this virus is transmitted by day biting Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.

slide 4 
- so actually doh has a national dengue prevention and control program and these are the 6 components of that program.
- as a data scientist, 2 main points of interest i found easily accessible are case surveillance and outbreak response
- if we are able to detect spikes in dengue cases early, we are able to respond better to outbreaks.
- we also create an opportunity for public health authorities to properly adjust to outbreaks in terms of preparation and creating public awareness

slide 8
- 2 things to take note of right now is:
    - spike of cases around the july-august mark which might indicate a yearly seasonality
    - large outbreaks every 2 years which might indicate a biennial seasonality

stationarity 
    - constant mean, standard dev, and variance in any given time frame for your time series data
